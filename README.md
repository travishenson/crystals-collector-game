# Crystals Collector Game
> Homework assignment: University of Richmond Full Stack Boot Camp 

## Overview
 In this game, the player is given a "Target Score" between 19-120 and four crystals, each with their own randomly assigned value between 1-12. The crystals' values are not shown to the player until the crystal is clicked. Every time a crystal is clicked, that number is added to the player's score. The goal of the game is to match the Target Score with the player score.

If the player's score matches, they earn a win, and the game is reset. If the score goes over, the player earns a loss, and the game is reset. There is also a manual reset button, which clears the wins/losses and randomly assigns new values to the crystals and target score.
